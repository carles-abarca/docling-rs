## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a **developer or researcher**, I want to **convert documents (PDFs, Word files, Markdown, etc.) to structured formats from the command line** so that I can **easily integrate document processing into scripts, pipelines, and workflows without writing code**.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Simple Single File Conversion
1. **Given** I have a PDF file `research-paper.pdf` in my current directory
2. **When** I run `docling-rs research-paper.pdf`
3. **Then** the system creates `research-paper.md` (Markdown) in the current directory with extracted content

#### Scenario 2: Multiple Output Formats
1. **Given** I have a PDF file `document.pdf`
2. **When** I run `docling-rs document.pdf --to json --to md --to text`
3. **Then** the system creates three files: `document.json`, `document.md`, `document.txt` with identical content in different formats

#### Scenario 3: Batch Directory Processing
1. **Given** I have a directory `./papers/` containing 10 PDF files and 5 DOCX files
2. **When** I run `docling-rs ./papers --from pdf --from docx --output ./converted`
3. **Then** the system converts all 15 files to Markdown format in `./converted/` directory, showing progress as it processes

#### Scenario 4: PDF-Specific OCR Processing
1. **Given** I have a scanned PDF `scan.pdf` with no embedded text
2. **When** I run `docling-rs scan.pdf --ocr --ocr-lang eng`
3. **Then** the system performs OCR on the PDF and outputs text extracted via optical character recognition

#### Scenario 5: Advanced PDF Enrichment
1. **Given** I have a technical paper `algorithms.pdf` with code blocks and formulas
2. **When** I run `docling-rs algorithms.pdf --enrich-code --enrich-formula --to json`
3. **Then** the output JSON contains structured code blocks and mathematical formulas identified separately from regular text

#### Scenario 6: Error Handling in Batch
1. **Given** I have a directory with 3 valid PDFs and 1 corrupted PDF
2. **When** I run `docling-rs ./batch --output ./results` (default: continue on error)
3. **Then** the system converts the 3 valid files, logs an error for the corrupted file, and continues processing

#### Scenario 7: Abort on First Error
1. **Given** I have a directory with files where the 2nd file is corrupted
2. **When** I run `docling-rs ./batch --abort-on-error`
3. **Then** the system converts the 1st file, encounters an error on the 2nd file, and stops immediately without processing remaining files

### Edge Cases
- What happens when **output file already exists**? ‚Üí System overwrites (or errors with clear message)
- What happens when **input file doesn't exist**? ‚Üí System shows error: "File not found: path/to/file.pdf" and exits with code 1
- What happens when **output directory doesn't exist**? ‚Üí System creates the directory automatically
- What happens when **unsupported format is specified**? ‚Üí System shows error: "Unsupported format: xyz" and lists supported formats
- What happens when **no input files match filter** (e.g., `--from pdf` but directory has no PDFs)? ‚Üí System shows warning: "No files found matching criteria" and exits with code 0
- What happens when **user provides invalid flag combination**? ‚Üí System shows error with helpful message and suggests correct usage
- What happens when **OCR feature is used but not compiled** (no `ocr` feature)? ‚Üí System shows error: "OCR feature not available. Recompile with --features ocr"
- What happens with **very large batch** (1000+ files)? ‚Üí System shows progress bar and processes all files without memory issues
- What happens when **file paths contain spaces**? ‚Üí System handles paths correctly (both quoted and unquoted)
