# Feature Specification: Advanced PDF Processing (Phase 3)

**Feature Branch**: `003-phase-3-pdf`
**Created**: 2025-10-05
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: "Phase 3: Advanced PDF Processing with layout analysis, table detection, and text extraction using native Rust libraries"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a Rust application developer, I need to extract structured content from PDF files including text, tables, images, and layout information, so that I can process complex PDF documents with high accuracy comparable to docling Python while maintaining native Rust performance.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a PDF with mixed content (text, tables, images), **When** the library processes it, **Then** it extracts all elements with their types, positions, and reading order

2. **Given** a multi-column PDF document, **When** the library analyzes layout, **Then** text is extracted in correct reading order respecting column flow

3. **Given** a PDF with tables, **When** the library detects table structures, **Then** tables are extracted with cell positions, content, and structure information

4. **Given** a PDF with embedded images, **When** the library processes it, **Then** images are detected with bounding boxes and can be extracted as bitmaps

5. **Given** a scanned PDF, **When** OCR is enabled, **Then** text is extracted from images with position and confidence information

6. **Given** a PDF with formulas and code blocks, **When** enrichment is enabled, **Then** these elements are identified and classified separately

7. **Given** a PDF with complex hierarchy (sections, headings, paragraphs), **When** the library processes it, **Then** document structure is preserved with correct nesting

### Edge Cases

- What happens when layout analysis model fails?
  - System MUST fall back to simple text extraction with warning

- What happens when a table spans multiple pages?
  - System MUST detect and link table fragments across pages

- What happens when OCR confidence is low?
  - System MUST include confidence scores and allow threshold configuration

- What happens when reading order is ambiguous?
  - System MUST use best-effort ordering with confidence indicators

- What happens with encrypted PDFs?
  - System MUST support password decryption for authorized access
