# Feature Specification: Advanced PDF Processing (Phase 4 - Future)

**Feature Branch**: `004-phase-4-avanzado`
**Created**: 2025-10-04
**Status**: Draft (Future Phase)
**Input**: User description: "Phase 4: Avanzado (Futuro) - Layout analysis - OCR (servicio externo) - Tablas"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a Rust application developer processing complex PDFs, I need advanced layout analysis, OCR for scanned documents, and table structure detection so that I can extract structured information from any PDF regardless of complexity or whether it contains searchable text.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a multi-column PDF document, **When** the library performs layout analysis, **Then** text is extracted in correct visual reading order respecting column boundaries

2. **Given** a scanned PDF with no text layer, **When** the library performs OCR via external service, **Then** text is extracted from the images and added to the DoclingDocument

3. **Given** a PDF with complex tables, **When** the library detects table structures, **Then** tables are represented with proper cell boundaries, headers, and row/column relationships

4. **Given** a PDF with mixed content (text, tables, images, headers, footers), **When** layout analysis is applied, **Then** content is segmented into logical blocks with correct reading order and semantic labels

5. **Given** a PDF with rotated or skewed scanned pages, **When** OCR is applied, **Then** the system detects orientation and corrects it before text extraction

6. **Given** a table spanning multiple pages, **When** the library processes it, **Then** the table is recognized as a single entity with continuation metadata

7. **Given** a PDF with nested tables or complex layouts, **When** layout analysis runs, **Then** hierarchical structure is preserved in the DoclingDocument

### Edge Cases

- What happens when OCR service is unavailable or slow?
  - System MUST timeout gracefully and return partial results with error metadata

- What happens when a table has merged cells or irregular structure?
  - System MUST make best effort to detect structure and mark ambiguous cells in metadata

- What happens when layout analysis detects conflicting reading orders?
  - System MUST apply heuristics to resolve conflicts and document confidence levels

- What happens when OCR confidence is low for certain regions?
  - System MUST include confidence scores in metadata and optionally flag low-confidence text

- What happens when a document has both searchable text and images requiring OCR?
  - System MUST combine embedded text with OCR results intelligently, avoiding duplication

- What happens when processing very large PDFs (100+ pages) with OCR?
  - System MUST support batch processing and progress reporting
