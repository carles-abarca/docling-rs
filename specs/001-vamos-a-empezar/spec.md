# Feature Specification: Core Document Processing Library (MVP Phase 1)

**Feature Branch**: `001-vamos-a-empezar`
**Created**: 2025-10-04
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "vamos a empezar con la Phase 1 (MVP): Core + Formatos Simples - Data models (DoclingDocument, etc.) - Backends: Markdown, HTML, CSV, DOCX - SimplePipeline - Sin funcionalidad CLI, el docling-rs sólo se consume como librería rust"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a Rust application developer, I need a library to extract structured text and metadata from common document formats (Markdown, HTML, CSV, DOCX) so that I can process documents programmatically without Python runtime dependencies.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a valid Markdown file on disk, **When** the library converts it to a DoclingDocument, **Then** the document contains all text content with preserved heading hierarchy and structure

2. **Given** a valid HTML file with tables and headings, **When** the library converts it to a DoclingDocument, **Then** the document preserves semantic structure (headings, paragraphs, tables, lists)

3. **Given** a valid CSV file with headers, **When** the library converts it to a DoclingDocument, **Then** the document contains tabular data with column headers and row data

4. **Given** a valid DOCX file with mixed content, **When** the library converts it to a DoclingDocument, **Then** the document contains all text, preserves formatting metadata, and maintains document structure

5. **Given** a file path to a supported format, **When** the library detects the file format automatically, **Then** the correct backend is selected for conversion

6. **Given** a DoclingDocument, **When** the library exports it to JSON, **Then** the JSON representation is valid and contains all document data

7. **Given** a DoclingDocument, **When** the library exports it to Markdown, **Then** the Markdown preserves the document structure and is human-readable

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a file is corrupted or malformed?
  - System MUST return a descriptive error without panicking

- What happens when a file format is unsupported?
  - System MUST return an error indicating unsupported format

- What happens when a file path does not exist?
  - System MUST return a file not found error

- What happens when a DOCX file contains embedded images?
  - System MUST extract image metadata and references (actual image processing deferred to later phases)

- What happens when an HTML file contains malformed markup?
  - System MUST make best effort to parse and return partial results with warnings

- What happens when a CSV file has inconsistent column counts?
  - System MUST handle gracefully, padding or truncating rows as needed

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Core Data Models

- **FR-004**: `DoclingDocument` MUST support text items with optional formatting metadata
- **FR-005**: `DoclingDocument` MUST support serialization to JSON format
- **FR-006**: `DoclingDocument` MUST support export to Markdown format
- **FR-007**: Library MUST provide an `InputDocument` type representing source documents
- **FR-008**: Library MUST provide a `ConversionResult` type containing input, output, and conversion status

#### Backend System
- **FR-009**: Library MUST provide a `Backend` trait for format-specific document loading
- **FR-010**: Library MUST provide a `DeclarativeBackend` trait for formats that convert directly to DoclingDocument
- **FR-011**: Markdown backend MUST parse Markdown files into DoclingDocument
- **FR-012**: HTML backend MUST parse HTML files into DoclingDocument
- **FR-013**: CSV backend MUST parse CSV files into DoclingDocument with table structure
- **FR-014**: DOCX backend MUST parse DOCX files into DoclingDocument
- **FR-015**: Each backend MUST validate input files before processing
- **FR-016**: Each backend MUST report supported formats
- **FR-017**: Backend MUST handle both file paths and in-memory byte streams

#### Pipeline System
- **FR-018**: Library MUST provide a `Pipeline` trait for document processing
- **FR-019**: Library MUST provide a `SimplePipeline` for declarative backends
- **FR-020**: SimplePipeline MUST execute: build → assemble → enrich stages
- **FR-021**: Pipeline MUST return ConversionResult with success/failure status
- **FR-022**: Pipeline MUST handle errors gracefully without panicking

#### Document Converter
- **FR-023**: Library MUST provide a `DocumentConverter` type as main entry point
- **FR-024**: DocumentConverter MUST automatically detect file format from extension or content
- **FR-025**: DocumentConverter MUST route documents to appropriate backend
- **FR-026**: DocumentConverter MUST support conversion from file path
- **FR-027**: DocumentConverter MUST support conversion from byte stream
- **FR-028**: DocumentConverter MUST allow format-specific configuration options

#### Error Handling
- **FR-029**: Library MUST use Result types for all operations that can fail
- **FR-030**: Library MUST provide specific error types for different failure scenarios
- **FR-031**: Errors MUST include descriptive messages and context
- **FR-032**: Library code MUST NOT panic (except for unrecoverable bugs)

#### Cross-Platform Support
- **FR-033**: Library MUST work on both Windows and macOS without platform-specific workarounds
- **FR-034**: File path handling MUST use platform-agnostic APIs
- **FR-035**: All file I/O MUST handle platform-specific line endings correctly

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance
- **NFR-001**: Small documents (<1MB) MUST convert in under 100ms on modern hardware
- **NFR-002**: Memory usage MUST scale linearly with document size
- **NFR-003**: Library MUST not load entire document into memory when streaming is possible

#### API Design
- **NFR-004**: Public API MUST follow Rust naming conventions and idioms
- **NFR-005**: API MUST be documented with rustdoc comments and examples
- **NFR-006**: API design MUST prioritize type safety and compile-time guarantees
- **NFR-007**: Library MUST minimize use of unsafe code (only where necessary with documented safety proofs)

#### Dependencies
- **NFR-008**: Library MUST use only native Rust crates (no Python bindings)
- **NFR-009**: Dependencies MUST be well-maintained and widely-used crates
- **NFR-010**: Dependency count MUST be minimized

#### Testing

- **NFR-013**: Contract tests MUST verify backend trait implementations
- **NFR-014**: Test coverage MUST be measured and reported

### Key Entities

- **DoclingDocument**: Unified document representation containing hierarchical structure, text items, metadata, and formatting information. Supports serialization and export to multiple formats.

- **InputDocument**: Represents a source document with file information, format detection, and reference to the backend instance.

- **ConversionResult**: Contains the input document, resulting DoclingDocument, conversion status (success/failure/partial), errors/warnings, and performance metrics.

- **Backend**: Format-specific component responsible for loading, validating, and converting a document format into DoclingDocument structure.

- **Pipeline**: Processing component that orchestrates the conversion workflow (build, assemble, enrich) and produces the final ConversionResult.

- **DocumentConverter**: Main library entry point that coordinates format detection, backend selection, and pipeline execution.

- **TextItem**: Represents a text element within a document with content, formatting metadata, and position information.

- **TableData**: Represents tabular data with cells, rows, columns, and optional headers.

- **NodeItem**: Represents hierarchical document elements (sections, paragraphs, lists) with parent-child relationships.
